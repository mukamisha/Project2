    <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born 
        and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character 
        of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order,
        twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
        <p>So, sincerly speaking , many peaple knows the date they were born on, but when you ask them the day,
            they won't be able to answer.that's why in have made an application that calculates the day someone was born.</p>
